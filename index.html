<p class="text-lg">
I have the experience and technical foundation of a computer scientist, which
means I'm not just comfortable with coding, but I also enjoy digging into
complex systems and understanding how they work. Computer Science is great, but my true passion is cybersecurity. I’ve explored many different areas within the field, but lately, I’ve been diving deeper into offensive security. I love learning and constantly expanding my skills to stay on top of the latest in cybersecurity.

    Assistant</h4>
    <p class="italic mb-2" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Baylor University - August 2024-Current</p>
    As a Research Assistant at Baylor University, I have contributed to a
    variety of cybersecurity projects, including research initiatives aimed
    at developing educational labs to teach cybersecurity principles. I have
    supported the organization and execution of cybersecurity
    competition: The Cybersecurity Interdisciplinary Incident
    Response Competition (CIIRC), and performed penetration testing on
    competition networks after establishing Rules of Engagement (ROE).
    Additionally, I created post-mortem reports to analyze findings and improve
    future competition frameworks. Currently, I am collaborating with Dr. Rivas
    on research involving AI/ML applications in offensive cybersecurity
    strategies and am excited to expand my experience in this emerging area.

    <p class="italic" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">General Motors - May 2024-August 2024</p>
    <p>
    During my internship at General Motors, I developed three distinct
    applications that were crucial to the operations of the Operating Systems
    Engineers (OSE) team. These applications were designed to be compatible with
    multiple operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and
    iOS. In building these solutions, I applied various software engineering
    principles such as General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns
    (GRASP) and Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). This experience provided me with
    valuable hands-on learning and reinforced my understanding of effective
    software design practices. It was a highly rewarding opportunity that
    deepened my technical skills and industry knowledge.

    <p>
    During my time at the Security Operations Center (SOC) for Baylor
    University, I gained hands-on experience with various cybersecurity tools
    and technologies. I developed proficiency in using Splunk for security
    information and event management (SIEM) and worked extensively with
    intrusion detection systems (IDS), including Host-based Intrusion Detection
    Systems (HIDS) and Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). This
    role enhanced my skills in real-time threat monitoring, log analysis, and
    incident response, providing a strong foundation in cybersecurity operations
    and defense strategies.

    <p>
    As an Information Technology Intern at General Motors, I worked with the
    Cyber Detect team, gaining hands-on industry experience in analyzing
    security logs and evaluating the severity of alerts. I utilized
    Microsoft Sentinel and 365 Defender to monitor and secure cloud
    environments. Additionally, I developed experience in using Jupyter
    Notebooks to automate security log analysis and aggregate detected data,
    in an effort to streamline the process of identifying potential threats
    for the team. Did not get to complete Jupyter Notebook assignment before
    internship deadline.

    <p>
    As a Student Network Technician at Baylor University, I gained valuable
    hands-on experience in network infrastructure management and support. My
    responsibilities included building and testing Ethernet cables using RJ45
    connectors, repairing network jacks, and frequently activating data ports to
    ensure reliable connectivity across campus. I regularly performed
maintenance and troubleshooting for Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs)
    and Main Distribution Frames (MDFs), ensuring optimal network performance
    and minimizing downtime. This role enhanced my understanding of physical
    network setups and provided me with practical skills in managing and

    <p class="italic" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Baylor University - January 2022 to August 2022</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Working as a Cybersecurity Student Worker has been one of my most rewarding
    experiences, as it gave me an opportunity to showcase my dedication and
    passion despite having limited technical skills when I started. I was
    initially offered this role not because of my expertise, but due to my
    commitment to learning and deep interest in cybersecurity. When I first
    joined, I had no prior knowledge of cybersecurity or computer science—even
    basic concepts like Linux were completely new to me. However, after spending
    countless hours completing labs for Dr. Donahoo on my own time, I was given
    the chance to turn my learning into a professional role.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    In this position, I was responsible for creating and maintaining virtual
    environments for Baylor's Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team.
    I managed and maintained a Proxmox cluster hosted on a server in a graduate
    laboratory, where I had hands-on access to configure and optimize resources.
    Each week, I designed complex, interdependent service environments to
    simulate real-world networks, such as setting up an Apache web server that
    relied on a MariaDB backend, or deploying Active Directory domains
    integrated with both Windows and Linux clients using RealmD. My role also
    included creating comprehensive documentation for Proxmox deployments to
    support the team’s understanding and use of the platform.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened
    my ability to tackle complex problems, design secure networks, and document
    technical processes effectively. It stands out as my favorite experience
    because my perseverance and strong learning mindset were rewarded,
    especially since that was not my initial intention.

    The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is a high-intensity incident
    response competition designed to provide students with a realistic
    experience in managing and defending a simulated corporate network
    infrastructure. Participants are tasked with identifying, responding to, and
    mitigating a variety of cybersecurity incidents while maintaining critical
    business operations. Teams must secure services, handle complex scenarios,
    and demonstrate effective teamwork and technical skills under pressure.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
    During my first year competing in CCDC, I was responsible for creating the
    network diagram and mapping out our environment. To achieve this, I developed
    custom nmap scripts to scan and map out the entire subnet. Once I identified the
    machines on our network, I conducted comprehensive port scans on all devices to
    determine which ports were open and potentially vulnerable. Following this, I
    created a preliminary attack surface report to outline potential threats and
    focus our defense strategy.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
    In my second year, I continued with similar responsibilities, but also took on
    the specialized role of our team’s LDAP expert. I managed all user
    modifications, onboarding, and offboarding processes, as well as implementing
    mass password resets and enforcing password policy changes on an OpenLDAP
    server. This expanded role allowed me to deepen my understanding of directory
    services and user management, while continuing to refine my skills in network
    mapping and incident response.

    <p class="mb-2">
    This year (Senior Year) I will be taking on the role of the Active Directory
    Expert. I will be our expert on any onboarding, offboarding, and gpos that
    could come our way.

    lot of time learning the basics and building a solid foundation in topics
    like networking, Linux, and web security. After covering the fundamentals, I
    moved on to the Red Teaming module, where I learned more about offensive
    security techniques like privilege escalation, moving between systems, and
    finding vulnerabilities. This gave me hands-on experience in how real-world
    attacks work and how to think like an attacker.

    to get more experience with real-world defensive strategies. During
    Hivestorm, we focused on identifying and fixing security misconfigurations,
    hardening systems, and keeping critical services up and running. It was a
    great way to practice defending understanding what it takes to keep a
    network secure.
